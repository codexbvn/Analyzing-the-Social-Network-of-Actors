# Analyzing the Social Network of OTT [Netflix] Actors

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing the social network of actors on the popular OTT platform Netflix. We explore the Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset, which contains information about various movies and TV shows available on Netflix.

## Dataset

We used the Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset, which consists of all the movies and TV shows provided by the OTT platform 'Netflix'. It contains attributes like Show ID, Type (Movie or TV Show), Title, Director, Cast, Country, Date Added, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Listed in, and Description.

## Data Visualization

We performed various data visualizations to gain insights into the Netflix dataset.

### Content Type

We plotted a pie chart showing the distribution of content types (movies and TV shows) in the Netflix dataset.

### Rating Category [Top 5]

We created a bar chart displaying the top 5 rating categories based on the number of movies or TV shows falling into each category.

### Top Directors

We identified the top directors based on the number of movies and TV shows they have directed and visualized the data in a bar chart.

### Top Actors

We determined the top actors based on the number of movies and TV shows they have appeared in and presented the results in a bar chart.

### Focus on Movies vs TV Shows in Recent Years

We analyzed the number of movies and TV shows released in recent years and visualized the trend using a line chart.

## Network Analysis

In this part, we constructed a social network of actors based on the Netflix dataset using the networkx library in Python.

### Actors with the Most Number of Movies

We found the actors who have appeared in the most number of movies and presented the results.

### Actor Partnerships

We identified actor partnerships based on the movies they have worked together in.

## Conclusion

This project allowed us to gain insights into the content distribution on Netflix, identify popular directors and actors, and analyze actor relationships within the Netflix dataset's movies and TV shows.
